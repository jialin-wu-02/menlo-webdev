# Web development Workshop for Menlo Hacks

Welcome Hackers. We will be going over the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. Three of the most essential building blocks of web development. We will also include a introduction to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), a popular and super-easy-to-use UI framework as a bonus. 

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to build this:

## HTML
HTML is the skeleton of any website. It is a kind of declarative languages that allows a website to display titles, paragraphs, image, and more on a browser. It is very easy to learn and simple to use. Let's see a basic example:

```HTML
<html>
<h1> Hello World! </h1>
<p> This is a paragraph. </p>
</html>
```

In HTML, everything should be put in between a pair of tags. A pair of tags contains an open tag and a closing tag: `<html>` is an open tag, and `</html>` is an closing tag. As you can see, by adding a `/`, the open tag would become a closing tag. 

Every tag has a different meaning and can be used to represent different elements in the website:
* The `<html>` tag means that everything in between the tag is the content of the HTML. 
* `<h1>` tag would make the thing in between the title of the website.
* `<p>` tag is a paragraph. 

There are several other tags that would be extremely useful and common in web development, they are:
* `<a>` tag is a link.
* `<img>` tag allows you to include a image.
* `<h2>`, `<h3>` allows you to adjust the "level", or the importance of the heading. The smaller the number, the more important the heading.
* `<button>` allows you to add a clickable button. 

Feel free to play around with the tags above. You can also explore the rest of the tags here:
